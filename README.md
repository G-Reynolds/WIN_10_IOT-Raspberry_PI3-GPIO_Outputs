# WIN_10_IOT-Raspberry_PI3-GPIO_Outputs
## Software to test Raspberry PI 3, all 24 GPIO pins as Outputs

Raspberry PI 3 Board, using Windows 10 IOT (OS version 10.0.16299.192).

Project in Visual Studio 2017, Visual C#, Universal Windows Platform (UWP).

All of the GPIO pins are all set to Outputs and all set to LOW when the software first runs.

The user with the GUI can then toggled any GPIO pin to HIGH or LOW.

Click on Toggle Buttons, the simulated LED displays on screen will show (Green = pin Low)  (Red = pin High).

REAL PI3 GPIO pins will follow the simulated LED displays (Low or High).

A handy demo / diagnostic tool to check the Raspberry PI 3 GPIO Outputs are functioning correctly.
